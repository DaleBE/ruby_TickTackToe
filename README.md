# ruby_TickTackToe
An exercise from The Odin Project's Ruby course.

The object of the exercise is to build a command line game of Tick Tack Toe where two players take turns placing their tokens on a three by three playing grid. The first to make a line either in a row, in a column or on the diagonal wins.
